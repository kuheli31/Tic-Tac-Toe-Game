# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the **Tic-Tac-Toe Game** repository! This is a simple and interactive implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game allows two players to take turns and compete to place their mark (either X or O) in a 3x3 grid to win the game.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Two-player mode**: Play with a friend locally.
- **Simple interface**: Easy-to-use and intuitive design.
- **Automatic game reset**: After every game, the board automatically resets for the next round.
- **Win condition**: The first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
- **Draw condition**: The game will declare a draw if no one wins after filling all the grid positions.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

1. Open the game in your browser or run it locally.
2. Player 1 will use `X` and Player 2 will use `O`.
3. Players take turns to place their marks in an empty cell on the 3x3 grid.
4. The first player to align three of their marks wins!
5. If all the cells are filled and no one wins, the game is a draw.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
